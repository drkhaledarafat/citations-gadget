(Verbose instruction for manually adding the Citation Gadget)

First of all it is advisable but not necessary to create a Google account (Any e-mail address is sufficient for this - no gmail account is required).

  1. In the right top corner of the page, click on "Personalised Home"
  1. Next Click on "Make it your own" text, located underneath the Google search input field and "Google search" button.
  1. Next click on "the entire collection" highlighted text in the same position as in previous section. (Below "Google search" button)
  1. In the top part of the page next to the "Search Homepage Content" button, click on "Add by URL" highlighted text.
  1. This will reveal a new window titled "Add by URL".
  1. In the box provided insert the following URL: http://citations-gadget.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/citGadget.xml
  1. Now click on the "Add" button right next to the input box.
  1. A dialog window will appear asking if you wish to add content not created by Google. Click on the "Ok" button to confirm.
  1. If the addition was successful, an orange tick icon will be displayed in the "Add by URL" window.
  1. Now click on "Back to homepage" in the top left corner of the website in order to return to your personalised home page.

If you have used Google personalised home page before:
